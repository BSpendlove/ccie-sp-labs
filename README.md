# containerlab-ccie-sp-labs
Labs for CCIE SPv5 in the format of containerlab topology yaml files. Does not include the images and some labs may contain a base configuration depending on what topic I am studying...

Each topic should be obvious which lab folder it belongs to but also other things such as Python scripts will be included in the relevant lab folders when I am working on the automation part of the exam...
